# SoftwareDevelopmentEffortPrediction
Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for Software Effort Prediction in Agile Development

The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning to software engineering. In particular, the goal to use natural language processing (NLP) for pasrsing through text describing software issues and requirements and machine learning for estimating/predicting the development effort required. The amount of effort is measured in story points, a common unit of measure that comes from agile development terminology used for estimating the effort involved in implementing a user story or resolving an issue. The idea is to feed a software issue/requirement description into a model to receive a development effort prediction in number of story points.
