"Steps to reproduce:    1. Create a simple Mule Studio project (for instance: the Echo example)  2. Push it into GitHub, pull/clone the repository into your local instance  3. Open up a brand new workspace  4. Goto Import/Git/Projects from Git  5. Select the local copy of your GitHub repository  6. Select import existing projects  7. Select the project created above  8. The import fails due to missing directories (see screenshot)    Note that if I do Import --> Mule project it works but then it doesn't recognise that it is a project managed by git so I cannot commit changes.    This is blocking me for the work I am doing with examples.    Edit: workaround: perform a Clean operation on the project.",,,
"Java source changes don't get picked up right now automatically (see STUDIO-381) however, even if a redeploy is triggered the latest java changes are not deployed",,,
"Unable to add a response when creating a second flow.    Steps to reproduce:    1) Open Studio and create a project from an existing template: Order Discounter.  2) In that same mflow file create another flow. Drag and drop HTTP RQ-RS, echo, flow reference, All router and component, echo and file, then file.  3) Try to add a response (echo component) like the one displayed for the template flow.  Unable to add a response, instead of that it lets me add the component between HTTP and SOAP component.    See screen shot.",,,
"When you add an element and then you remove it, the reference to the schema file is not being removed from the XML namespaces.      Steps to reproduce:   1.- Create a project in Studio with a flow in it and go to the Global Elements tab.   2.- Add for example a global Jetty endpoint with the default values.   3.- Go to the XML view and check that the xml code for the endpoint is there with reference to the mule-jetty.xsd in the namespaces  4.- Go back to the global elements tab and delete the endpoint.     Issue: Now if you go back to the XML view, the code for the endpoint is not there as ti should but the reference to the mule-jetty.xsd is still there and it shouldn't as there is no jetty element in the flow or in the global elements tab.     Be very careful when implementing this as the reference in the namespaces should be remve if there is no other instance of the element kind in a flow or as a global element such as a global endpoint or connector, but if there is no reference to an element kind (ex: some jetty element) there is no reason for the namespace to be there.

Add a button in the ClassFieldEditor to create the class inline. ,,,
"Currently, to view the class code (e.g., component) specified in the widget configuration, I have to leave the dialog box to find it. A very desirable feature would be to view the class code (as a separate tab in the editor ) just by clicking on the class name displayed in the widget dialog box.",,,
"Steps to reproduce:   1.- Create a project in STUDIO with a flow and a sub-flow  2.- Go to the Flow properties window and set the Exception Subflow ref combo to the subflow that you have. Clic OK.   3.- Change the name of the subflow.  4.- Open the flow properties window, the subflow ref is blank    Expected behavior: the reference should be preserved no matters if the user decides to change the subflow name.   ",,,
"it seems we could have a single filter element in the flow control section that has one dialog that allows people to select an expression (this works for wildcard and regex) and have a section below to allow the user to add new filters with AND, OR or NOT.    I think this provides much better usability as there is now only a single filter element not a whole palette.  And it makes working with logic filters more natural for the user. i.e.it feels odd to have to start with an AND filter and then configure the expressions",,,
"My config is as follows:  <flow name=""TicketFlowFlow1"" doc:name=""TicketFlowFlow1"">          <composite-source>              <http:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" host=""localhost"" port=""8081"" doc:name=""HTTP""/>              <vm:inbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" path=""helloworld"" responseTimeout=""10000"" mimeType=""text/plain"" doc:name=""VM""/>          </composite-source>          <component class=""com.mulesoft.Component1"" doc:name=""Java""/>          <http:outbound-endpoint exchange-pattern=""request-response"" host=""localhost"" port=""8081"" doc:name=""HTTP""/>          <response>              <component class=""com.mulesoft.Component2"" doc:name=""Java""/>       	          </response>      </flow>    But the response is not displayed (see the pic attached)",,,
I am able to drag and drop composite source and poll as response elements of a flow. This is not correct: we should not let the user be able to drop composite source and poll there.     When dropping them as response elements an empty response box is created and in the XML configuration this is written:  <response/>    I am attaching a screen shot.,,,
"This is a usability issue: There is no specification when there is a global endpoint or a connector created in the global elements table, they are just called the same and it is confusing.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Create an FTP global endpoint.  2. Create an FTP connector.  They have the same type and name in the global elements table (For the name there is already a Jira opened for that).     Type should specify if it is a global endpoint or a connector. Nowadays I think that type is useless, it doesn't say anything to the user. It just says ""FTP (EE)"" for global endpoint or connector. Same happens for the rest of the global endpoints and connectors and this is pretty confusing!!!",,,
"Created a Java to XML mapping and configured a lookup table with 2 fields: subject(Key) and email.  Executed the Preview an error message was displayed: ""Message:Transform Failed!"" (see attached screenshot)    ",,,
Unable to create a new mapping using an excel spreadsheet with the new format .xlsx    To reproduce:  - Create new mapping  - Input: Select MS Excel  - Add the .xlsx spreadsheet attached to this issue  - Output: Select anything  - Click Finish button (error is displayed in the error log)    See attached screenshot of error.,,,
"1. Element JAX-WS Service is not allowed to be child element of HTTP.    Oh, it is allowed, and often times it makes perfect sense to have it as a child element rather than subsequent one. False alarm.    2. Flow should start with inbound endpoint    No, it does not have to.    3. Response is not allowed to be child of element HTTP    Of course, it is allowed :)  ",,,
Steps to reproduce:   1.- Go to the global elements tab and create any element.   2.- Remove it.   3.- Press Ctrl + z or Command + z     Issue: the element does not appears again  ,,,
"Steps to reproduce:  1 - Create a project  2 - Run it as a mule application  3 - Try to delete the project, including files.    An error dialog will pop up, related to mule still using the files and directories that are being deleted. To complete his desire to delete the project, the user will have to abort the operation (undo won't undo anything at all), stop mule, and try again.    Studio should prompt for the user's consent to stop the running mule instance if there is one running the applications of a project that is being deleted, so that the Delete operation does not fail, or otherwise gets cancelled.",,,
"To see or edit the ""Auto delete"" option of the File connector you have to:  - Go to the end point properties  - The choose ""Reference""  - Add a reference in Global References->Connector Reference  - The autodelete option is there (see the attached screenshot)",,,
It would be nice if you could support jaxb operations from GUI such as jaxb-xml-to-object-transformer jaxb-context etc.,,,
"It should be much easier to navigate from the GUI to the appropriate XML element or flow block within the XML. Furthermore, it would be great to go the other way as well, to click on an XML element and bring the user directly to a highlighted flow element within the GUI.",,,
"(edit) This bug was first discovered for exception strategies. This is the description for that case:    When using the Message Flow tab, you can't drop inbound-only-endpoints into exception strategies (the UI forbids it). But you are able to do so through the XML, and there isn't any validation or indication that this is invalid.    Example:  {code:xml}<catch-exception-strategy>              <imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143"" responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP""/>          </catch-exception-strategy>{code}    This is invalid (IMAP is inbound, and only inbound), but there are no error markers whatsoever present. It should:  * be underlined in the XML  * present a problem in the Problems pane  * be drawn with the red-x in the Message Flow tab    This is also valid for any other kind of scope that has the restriction to start only with inbound or outbound endpoints. Some sample snippets that should fail, but dont:    {code:xml}<sub-flow name=""asdfFlow4"" doc:name=""asdfFlow4"">  		<imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143""  			responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP"" />  	</sub-flow>{code}    {code:xml}<composite-source>  			<smtp:outbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""25""  				responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""SMTP"" />  		</composite-source>{code}    {code:xml}<poll frequency=""1000"">  			<imap:inbound-endpoint host=""localhost"" port=""143""  				responseTimeout=""10000"" doc:name=""IMAP"" />  		</poll>{code}",,,
"When unzipping MuleStudio in a long path (For example under Desktop or Document and Settings)  the errors shown in the attached screenshots may be shown.    The password protected error seems to be a Windows bug as explained in http://blogs.msdn.com/b/robcaron/archive/2006/09/14/755306.aspx    The problem is that this seems to be a Windows limitation and there is no much that can be changed in Studio to fix the issue (most of the failing files are eclipse classes)    The workaround is to install Studio in a simpler and shorter directory (For example C:\MuleStudio)    We need to add this in the release notes and see how to document it better for users.    Some other stuff to test:    # Does this happens with Winzip or Winrar (Or is only a problem of the default zip utility that comes with Windows)  # Once extracted in C:\MuleStudio, can the directory me moved to another location?  # Which specific versions of Windows present this issue?",,,

"Unlike other windows programs, Studio cannot be pinned to the taskbar for quick access.

As defined by the specification.,,,
"Whenever Studio starts, we should send a GET request to the following URL:  http://<ch-app-hrl>/e?&_p=<studio-id>&_n=<example-name>  Where <studio-id> is a unique ID associated with the downloaded Studio instance, and <example-name> is the name of the example.   The CloudHub hosted service should in turn make a call to a KissMetrics event of the same name as the example using the following URL:  http://trk.kissmetrics.com/e?_k=b276fa8e23213db7fba9868b5d3ba750344cdbb1&_p=123&_n=studiostartedevent  The CloudHub service then effectively acts as a proxy between Studio and the KissMetrics event.   In case that the CloudHub service is not available or that there is no connectivity to the CloudHub service from the machine on which the example is being executed, the URL call-out should fail gracefully with no noticeable effect from the Studio user's point of view.

"Today we show MySQL, Derby, and Oracle. However, MS SQL and DB2 are RDBMS's with very large footprints. As such, we should add these two databases to the set that shows up on the JDBC connector's configuration screen. ",,,
Only queryKey is marked as mandatory for JDBC endpoint while Address is a valid attribute if queryKey is not specified.    A query should be referenced from the JDBC endpoint by queryKey or Address.    Nowadays when you have specified the Address attribute and not the queryKey you get an error saying Please specify a query.,,,
"Since it's not possible to add a context:property-place-holder tag from the pallete, I switched to the editor view and used auto competion to generate this declaration:    <context:property-placeholder location=""mule.properties"" />    Studio added the xmlns automatically, but the xsi:location looked like this:    xsi:schemaLocation=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/context null    After fixing the location manually, the app started fine",,,
"when deploying an app in cloudhub, the actual file upload can take a while depending on the connection and the app size. During that time, there's no way of knowing if the app is still responsive and you can't do anything else.    Also, if after pushing the button I just realized I forgot something I can't abort the proces.    Lastly, it'd be nice to have the Run in backgroun option that many eclipse dialogs have.    ",,,
"A flow shows the request and response message flow inside a flow using arrows with different direction: request goes from left to right, response foes from right to left.  That is not the case when there is a ""response"" component which is part of the response flow: the arrows inside the response go from left to right like in the request flow.    I would expect the components inside the response element are displayed in reverse order so the arrow that shows the direction of the flow goes from right to left.",,,
"In Windows, when direct-editing the display name of an element in the canvas, the ""editing box"" has a couple of strange behaviors:    * When writing the name from scratch (erase everything and start writing), the FIRST character shows, but upon typing the second character, the first one will not be visible (though it is still there).  * When the display name is empty, the editing box shows from the middle expanding to the right (this is platform independent). It would be nicer if it showed centered on the element image.",,,
"It should be really cool that when on the field editor or the data source editor when you hit the tab key you get to the other column or at lease the other row.    Now a days  it just focus on the OK button, so you have to move with the mouse to navigate the grid ",,,

"Hi     Our user is still seeing these crashing issues with Studio even after applying all of the updates.     Here is what they've told me.     They have a project with a main flow and multiple sub flows. They think part of the issue may be how Mule is updating the multiple flow files because They’ve gotten the error in a few scenarios (although they don’t have full replication steps yet):     Steps that caused it this time:     1.	The flow being referenced changes names, and the original name and new name both show up in the flow reference drop down.   2.	I try to reference a second sub flow that is above the first sub flow (I have multiple sub flows in the file). Once I add in the flow reference for subflow1 to call subflow2 then I get the error.   a.	Note: when I moved subflow2 below subflow1, the issue corrected itself.

The problem I find is that because I am limited on the comments I can make on the studio canvas on message processors (name:doc) I end up also writing comments in the xml, this spreading out of comments to describe what the application is doing can be confusing.. I believe we need to come up with a strategy and common way of making comments, this could potentially be addressed by : http://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/STUDIO-2550    What I like about making notes in the xml is that I can view all the notes without having to click into components or hovering my mouse over them in the GUI.... I would probably use the description attribute to give detailed description of what the message processor does and then I would like to sometimes be able to put a 1/2 line brief description of what it does somewhere on the canvas. because doc:name attribute does not do text wrap and descriptions over a few words make the canvas look messy and forces message processors to spread out this is not a good way of labelling..

"How to re-crecreate:   (1) Create global endpoints (i.e. file:endpoint)in a dedicated flow file to store all global components.   (2) Then reference the global endpoints across from separate flow files.  (3) Complete the flow and test it to make sure it is working.   (4) Using the graphical editor(Message Flow tab) to edit the Display Name of each node.  At this point all the references will be removed, the flow will be broken.     The explanation:     We are trying to introduce the test driven development using the FunctionalTest.    For this, we need to put all the endpoints together with their connectors to a separate dedicated flow file. Then in the src/test/resources, we create a test flow file that contains the corresponding endpoints (with the same name) that will replace the real endpoints in the functional test.   However, the MuleStudio fail to recognise the global endpoints ferenced from across the separate flow file. Even worse, it keeps removing them while it is perfectlu legal in terms of mule.    Suggestion of fix:     option 1:    Able to recognise the global endpoints across different flow files    Option 2:   Just ignore the attributes and values it does not understand and put a warning sign instead of removing them. This may be preferable since MuleStudio may not understand all the added feature of the Mule components...   For example, MessagePropertiesTransformer has the scope attribute, this will be removed by the MuleStudio because it does not understand it.    Also it will be nice not to try to create mflow files for the files in src/test/resources, so that it will not complain about the uniqueue reference etc.... I know this should be another JIRA ticket :)                  ",,,

"As a developer, I want to be able to tell data mapper to use the structure from any object my connector is aware of for the mapping.     For example, let's say I want to query Salesforce and that query returns a List of Account objects. Because Studio is not yet aware of the query structure and what object it returns, I need a way to specify that the input to a mapping is a List of Accounts.    Right now I can only select connector metadata from an operation that is already metadata aware.    So, I should be able to browse all the objects my connector is aware of (i.e. MetadataKeys) and then select that I want my data mapper input/output to be either one of those objects or a List of one of those objects.",,,

In addition, it would help the user if the ""Generate default"" option is renamed to ""Generate default from output"" for the input section, and ""Generate default from input"" for the output section.",,,

"Right now DataSense supports two types of metadata:    * Static: Which is completely obtained from Instrospection of pojos  * Dynamic: Completely obtained from @MetadataRetriever method    Connectors such as Netsuite or ServiceSource present a hybrid case, in which most of the metadata is static, but the pojos that the connector handle have an internal map to represent custom fields. Right now there's no support OOTB for this and the case needs to be handled manually at the metadata retriever, forcing the user to instrospect the object by hand.    Also, if forces the connector to have two versions for each processor. For example, consider the following:    public MyPojo create(@Optional @Default(""#[payload]"") MyPojo pojo) { ... }    There's no way to make use of DataSense in that processor. Then, you're forced to add a second processor that looks like this:    public Map<String, Object> dynamicCreate(@MetadataKeyParam String type, @Optional @Default(""#[payload]) Map<String, Object>) { ... }    PROPOSAL    One solution that I can think of for this problem is to enable this hybrid cases by creating a new annotation called @MetadataDynamic or something like that. Then, the connector's pojos can annotate the map of dynamic fields with that annotation. Then, Studio/Devkit can scan for that annotation and automatically generate instrospection Medatata for that pojo, so that the metadata provider can only worry about custom types. This annotation should also be used to leverage DataSense in processors using such pojos so that we don't have to make dynamicXXX processors",,,

"The tool-tips for the new watermark are very complex.  I propose the following changes:  Variable Name: This attribute signals both the object store key that will be used to store this watermark as also the name of the flow variable in which its value will be exposed to the user. NEW: Define the variable name.  Default Expression: In case that the key above can't be found in the object store, the default expression is used to generate a value. This is useful in the case of the very first poll. NEW: Define where the poll should start.  Update Expression: The result of this expression will be used to update the watermark once the execution is finished. NEW: Updates the watermark expression after the poll runs. (OPTIONAL)  Object Store: A reference to the object store you wish to use to store the watermarks.  If not provided, the default object store will be used. NEW: Specify an object store other than the default. (OPTIONAL)",,,
"As a Studio developer, I would like to be able to use the Service auto-discovery feature of the Anypoint Service Registry as follows:  - Be able graphically configure the service configuration information as a global element by configuring it through the global element tab.   - Be able to configure, through the XML tab, any ASR supported inbound endpoint with a <sr:auto-register-as> element.  Any Mule flow configured as such should work withouth errors or unkown elements showing as I switch back and forth between the Studio XML and graphical views. ",,,

"When creating a new Mule project, Studio allows you to use a name of another project which is already present on disk (but not in your workspace).    Steps to reproduce:    1) Create a new Mule Project and call it ""MyProject""  2) Delete this project from the workspace but do not remove the project's contents from your disk  3) Attempt to create a new project with the same name.    Mule should at least let you know that another project with the same name is already present in your workspace.",,,

"Several connectors such as PeopleSoft, Siebel, .Net, Oracle EBS need data sense for modeling objects + entities.     A concrete use case is the following, PeopleSoft support entities called Component Interfaces that model objects with they operations.

This means that if we have a component interface User will operations [create,delete,insert], we need to create a 3 keys [""User#create"",""User#delete"",""User#insert""].

"Nowadays, studio is not forcing to use ipv4, so any app can be deployed using any already taken ipv4 port. As a consequence, you can deploy an app in Mule and then deploy the same app in Studio, without errors.    Scenario 1 (using Mule 3.7):  - Deploy the attached config in Mule 3.7.0. Notice that the port is hardcoded to 8082  - Deploy the same app in Studio.  - Check the console and the terminal. Both logs show that the apps are deployed, without errors. Studio app should throw an exception saying that the port is already in use.  - Go to a new terminal, and run the command ""netstat -an | grep 8082"". You will see that the 8082 is listening, with tcp4 and tcp46. (See image1.jpg)  - If you make a request to http://localhost:8082, mule will answer that request, and studio will throw a Broken Pipe Exception.    This issue does not happen if you run the apps in the inverted order (First studio, Second Mule). In that case, Mule throws an exception saying that the port is already in use.    Scenario 2 (using ports of the other programs):  - Go to a terminal and run the command ""netstat -an""  - Look for an already taken port using tcp4 (for example in image2.jpg you can see that the ports 49298 and 63342 are not available)  - Deploy the attached app, changing the listener port to one of the previous ones.  - The app is deployed instead of saying that the port is already in use.

"As a user I would like to have an option to customise the palette so that I can choose what elements appear in it. This option should appear both as a preference page and as an accesible button in the palette view which will open the aforementioned preference page.    The preference page will allow to:    - Define new presets (A preset is a collection of categories and elements that are important to the user and that the user selects)  - Remove new presets  - Edit already created presets  - Select categories and elements that will be stored in the preset    When the user clicks ""Apply"" or ""Ok"" the palette must be updated with the elements of the selected preset.    Some considerations to take into account about presets:    - Presets will be stored as preferences as a workspace level.  - Each preset is associated to a runtime version. Then, a preset can be used in projects with the same runtime version.  - The preset preference page will not show presets that were created for a different runtime version than the current in-use project. For example, if a preset was created using a Mule project with 3.5 runtime, it will not be shown (in the preference page) when a user is working on a project that is using 3.7.  - The preference page must present at least a ""Default preset"" and a ""Weave Preset"". The first one will show all the elements (categories and message processors) that exist in the current runtime, that's the runtime that is being used by the current Mule project. The second one will show all the elements BUT NOT the transformers, instead the new Weave transformer must be shown. Both presets CAN'T be edited.    As a nice-to-have presets should be imported/exported in order to share them with others users.",,,
